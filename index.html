<h1> Happy Fall Y'all! </h1>
<p1>
    <nav class="p1">
         Since it is the fall season, come on down to Sprout and Grow, and bring the whole family to have some family bonding time! 
    We have an amazing selection of pumpkins, flowers, and plants of all kinds. 
    We have also recently opened our concession stand, and we are now serving ice cream, popcorn, hotdogs, and much more! 
    So come spend this crisp fall season outdoors, while also spending quality time with your family.

    <nav class="p2"> For our teachers and classes, we are also offering fieldtrips! 
    We will show you we run our nursery and what it takes to take care of our plants.
    At the end, we will all sit down and enjoy some homemade ice cream!
    So be sure to let your teacher and class know that Sprout and Grow is the place to be this season!
